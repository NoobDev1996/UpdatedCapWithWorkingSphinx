Hi, I had a mentor call with Serge Mughemuzi and we tried to analyze the issue with my L3T10, and he said one of the issues could be a port forwarding issue so he asked me to resubmit it with this note, mentioning the port issue he also said he would speak to the last reviewer who reviewed my task. I will book another call for tomorrow to try and see if the issue is resolved. He recommended trying to clear your ports and running it from localhost:8080
